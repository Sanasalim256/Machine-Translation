# Machine-Translation
Machine translation (MT) is an automated translation process that can be used when a fully human translation process is insufficient in terms of budget or speed. This is achieved by having computer programs break down a source text and automatically translate it into another language.

It is an information system where input data passes through several interconnected nodes to generate an output. Neural machine translation software uses neural networks to work with enormous datasets. Each node makes one attributed change of source text to target text until the output node gives the final result.
Some machine translation tools are better suited for certain types of text than others. For example, Google Translate is good for translating short, simple sentences, while DeepL is better for translating longer, more complex texts.
